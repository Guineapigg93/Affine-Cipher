# Affine-Cipher
Just some stuff playing around with the Affine Cipher. Not the most elegant code, but, functional.

The affine_bruteforce.py script simply brute forces its way through encrypted Affine text. It's a pretty comment-heavy file, as I walk the reader through what I'm doing at each step and why. affine_bruteforce_clean.py is a cleaner version, and affine_bruteforce_nocomment.py is a commentless version. 

The script affine_encrypt.py allows you to encrypt a plaintext using the Affine algorithm.
